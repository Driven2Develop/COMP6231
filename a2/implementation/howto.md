## Threading
- use standard threading library

## Multi-Processing
- use standard multiprocessing library

## MPI
- use [mpi4py](https://pypi.org/project/mpi4py/) library

## How To Run
- Running threading and multi-processing code is straightforward `python code.py`.
- To run MPI code, run `mpiexec -n 4 python code.py`
- While using test.py, since t3 of each question will use mpi, running test.py won't work directly.
- While testing your t3 for each question, comment other lines.
