# T1 file server

## Instructions to complete Task 1 **(Part E, F) **
1. create network for client and file_server connectivity ```docker network create dev_network```
* We can check the network status with ```docker inspect network dev_network```

2. Initialize the server and start server python script, the server should be listening for connections
```
docker run --name file_server -p 65432:65432 --net dev_network --mount type=bind,source="C:\Workspace\School\fall-2023\COMP6231_Distributed_Systems\homework\a3\T1_file_server\server.py",target="/scripts/server.py" --shm-size 2GB -it ozxx33/fileserver-baseÂ 
```
* Start the server Python script with ```python scripts/server.py```
* The server should now be listening for connections

3. Commit the server's image **(Part G)**
* We typically commit images to reuse them during debugging ```docker commit file_server ozxx33/fileserver-base```
* the commits capture the image during a certain status such as volumes, networks, or other parameters. 
* If we make a mistake we can always revert back to a committed image.  


4. start clients on the same network as the server
```
docker run --name client1 --security-opt=seccomp:unconfined -p 8080:8080 --net=dev_network --mount type=bind,source="C:\Workspace\School\fall-2023\COMP6231_Distributed_Systems\homework\a3\T1_file_server\client.py",target="/scripts/client.py" --shm-size 30GB -it ozxx33/fileserver-base

docker run --name client2 --security-opt=seccomp:unconfined -p 8181:8181 --net=dev_network --mount type=bind,source="C:\Workspace\School\fall-2023\COMP6231_Distributed_Systems\homework\a3\T1_file_server\client.py",target="/scripts/client.py" --shm-size 30GB -it ozxx33/fileserver-base

docker run --name client3 --security-opt=seccomp:unconfined -p 8282:8282 --net=dev_network --mount type=bind,source="C:\Workspace\School\fall-2023\COMP6231_Distributed_Systems\homework\a3\T1_file_server\client.py",target="/scripts/client.py" --shm-size 30GB -it ozxx33/fileserver-base
```
* navigate to the python file located in the /scripts directory
* be sure to specify the server IP before running the client.py [server IP address]

## Sockets used **(Part D)**
* Server:
    * Port Binding 65432:65432
    * Listening 0.0.0.0:65432
* Client 1: 
    * Port Binding 8080:8080

    * Connecting to 172.17.0.2:65432

## Sample output logs **(Part A, B, C)**
Logs can be obtained from docker desktop, or  with the command ```docker logs mpi_container_1``` or directly on the container. The following Logs were obtaining from executing instructions in Part A and B.
